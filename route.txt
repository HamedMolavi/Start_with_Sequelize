1. make connection with database => database/connection.js => There is no need to have connection in app.js, because you just need
it to define your models (like in mongoose).

2. So to make a model for each database table we require connection and use the sequelize syntax to make a model => database/models

3. After making our models we need to migrate them. this means to make sure that a model will be sync to a existed table in database.
But this action only needs to be runned once when server is going to be run for the first time => database/migrate.js => We need to
require all of the models an sync them in this file, so when ever a new model is defined we need to alter this file too.

4. To set the migrate.js run only once we can:
    1) Set a script in package.json and run it only once in server first running.
    2) Set a script called first and use third party module "npm-run-all".
    3) You can run this file every time the server goes up, in this solution you can move loggin connection has established to
    migrate file.

5. After setting api routes, if you want to distinguish 400 and 500 errors, you can use instaseof => routes/user

6. To do reusable our code we can write a function for it => urils/errorHandler

7. Now lets go back to validation handling. make a property named "validate" in every coloumn of model. Then write your validations.
Note the syntax. => database/models/User => to have a custom validation we can use "validator" package (see phone number field).
